# EPA Data Visualization

This project accesses data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency databases using the [Envirofacts Data Service API](https://www.epa.gov/enviro/envirofacts-data-service-api).

The geographic coordinates and the carbon dioxide emissions of 100,000 establishments across the United States are displayed in the form of a Heatmap using [Heatmap.js](https://www.patrick-wied.at/static/heatmapjs/) and [leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/).

These carbon dioxide emitters are divided into sectors such as Power Plants, Hydrogen Production, and Military.

Users are able to view the distribution and magnitude of emissions across different sectors.
